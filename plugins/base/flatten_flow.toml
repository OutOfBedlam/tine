[[flows.flatten]]
    ## This flow flattens a record into multiple records,
    ## the individual field of the record converted to a "_ts, name, value" record except "_ts" and "_in" field.
    ## The new "name" field is formed by concatenating the original "_in" value and the field name.
    ## For example, if the original record is {"_ts": timestamp, "_in": "my", "field1": 1, "field2": 2} and name_infix is "_" (which is the default),
    ## then the new records will be:
    ##    {"_ts": timestamp, "name": "my_field1", "value": 1}
    ##    {"_ts": timestamp, "name": "my_field2", "value": 2}
    ## If "_in" field does not exist in the record, the "name" is not changed and keep the original field's name.
    name_infix = "_"
