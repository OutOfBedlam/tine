    ## For example, if the orginal record is {"_ts": timestamp, "_in": "my", "field1": 1, "field2": 2} and name_infix is "_" (which is the default),
    ## then the new records will be:
    ##    {"_ts": timestamp, "name": "my_field1", "value": 1}
    ##    {"_ts": timestamp, "name": "my_field2", "value": 2}
