    ## It stores all records in memory first then write to the file 
    ## when the count of the buffered records in memory reaches to "records_per_file".
    ## So, every excel file it writes has "records_per_file" rows. (+ 1 header row)
    ## If records_per_file is 0, it will keep all records in memory (consuming memory) 
    ## and write to the file when the pipeline is closed.
    ## (default 20000)
    records_per_file = 20000
